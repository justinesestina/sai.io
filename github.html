    <P>So, here it is. I just want to ask, how do you feel about my surprise, love? Hahaha, honestly, love. I planned to make this website for you a long time ago. But it was hard because while I was thinking about the concept and design, I struggled to find the time to do it. If you look at the overall appearance of this website, it’s not that beautiful, but I know you appreciate small things, so I let go of my perfectionism just to finish this for you and give it to you on time. If I tried to make it perfect, I wouldn’t have finished it by our monthsary. So, I sacrificed some aesthetics to complete it earlier. But don’t worry, if I get more time, I’ll make it even better.

  <P>Anyway, there’s nothing too special about this website, love. I made it because I want to express my feelings to you. I told you before that writing letters or love letters is a weakness of mine, especially handwritten ones. I swear, I’d struggle. So, I thought of doing it in a unique way that I think I’m good at. And here it is, I did it! Congrats to me. I made this because I know you’ll like it too. Ishie mentioned that you love love letters, and I see that in you. When I found that out during our courting stage, I got so nervous. Why? Because I know it’s hard for me to do that. First, I’m not expressive, so how would I do that, right? It might take me days or weeks to start. Second, I’m not good at making people feel special with words. Well, one of my love languages is words of affirmation, but I can’t apply it to myself sometimes, especially when it’s for a girl I like. You know that feeling when you want to compliment someone you like, but you can’t because you know you’re not good at it? Haha. I don’t find it cringe, okay? Maybe I just lack the confidence to throw sweet words to the person I like. But you know what, love? Because of you, I started to change that. That’s how much I wanted to pursue you back then. When I realized I like you, I thought I could change myself for the person I want, and that’s you. I’m not fully changed yet, but I see that I can make you feel special with my words, right, love? You feel special when I compliment you, don’t you? Hehe, because, love, it’s true. You know, it’s rare for me to be attracted to a girl’s physical appearance, especially the face, but when you talked to me and I looked at your pictures or saw you in person, I kept saying how beautiful you are. Like, really, love. You’re so beautiful, believe me. It’s not because I’m your boyfriend that I say this, NO. I say this because it’s true. Your eyes are as beautiful as colorful butterflies, so lovely to look at. And your smile, ahhh!! I can’t explain it, but every time I see you smile, I melt. You know, no matter how tired I am, when I see your smile, I feel better instantly. It’s like all my tiredness disappears just because of your smile. Honestly, I feel like you’re the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen in my life. I’m so blessed that God gave you to me, a full package. I won’t ask for anything more from another girl because you have it all.</P>
    <br>
       <p>So I want to tell you, love, that you don’t have to worry about me leaving you for someone else. That will never happen, I promise. When I say you’re the one, I mean it. I don’t just like you, love. I love you, and I won’t waste this gift that God has given me. NO. I’m already contended with you, and this is forever, okay? You’re the one I’ll marry soon. It’s early to say, but I’ve decided. That’s it for this part. I LOVE YOU!!!</P>
