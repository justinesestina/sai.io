			Sai,
		 	<br>
			<br> Okay, lastly, my love. Again, happy monthsary! I don‚Äôt know how to express how happy I am that we‚Äôve reached our sixth month together. Yes, this month has been really tough for us. We had several arguments this month. And of course, it still makes me sad when I think about the times I hurt you. I feel really bad because I know I hurt you several times. I regret that those things happened. You know I never meant to hurt you. Why would I? I love you, so why would I intentionally hurt the one I love? Sometimes, situations play with us, and we do things that affect others without meaning to. So, I want to apologize for all of that, for all my mistakes this past month. I won‚Äôt list them one by one because it‚Äôs in the past and there‚Äôs no need to dwell on it. But I still want to ask for your forgiveness for all the wrongs I did. It‚Äôs not your fault that I hurt you; it‚Äôs all mine, and I regret it deeply. Don‚Äôt worry, love. I will correct all my mistakes. I won‚Äôt let myself lack the time to improve, just like you. We both want to become the best versions of ourselves for each other, and I know that will happen, not now, but soon. We don‚Äôt need to rush; we need time, and I‚Äôm willing to wait for that time.
			 <br>
			<br>Love, I want to tell you that the man you‚Äôre building up now will not go to anyone else, just to you. I promise that. No matter how bad or chaotic our situation gets, I will choose to stay and fix it. I don‚Äôt want anyone else; I am content with what we have now. I will do my best to make you feel the love you deserve, the love you want. You want to feel that from me, and I promise I will do everything to give that to you.
			<br>
			 <br>
			 <br>Thank you for everything, baby. For making me feel loved, special, and cared for. Thank you for everything you did for me. I‚Äôve been so happy since you came into my life, truly happy. I can‚Äôt show how happy I am now, but my heart is overflowing with joy. Thank you for being such a great person, my love. I am out of words to tell you how grateful I am to have you. Don‚Äôt worry because all your sacrifices for this relationship will be worth it, I promise.
			 <br>
			 <br>Yes, love. yes. Promise, we will marry each other. I will marry you, even if it‚Äôs early to say this. But I‚Äôm not a kid anymore to not know what decision I want for myself. It‚Äôs you. You are the woman I want to spend my whole life with. So, no matter what happens, we won‚Äôt give up on us, okay? No matter how hard or chaotic it gets, we‚Äôll help each other, right? We will create our destiny, love. The decision is ours, and we can reach that dream together. No matter what happens, I will choose you. You are the only one I see myself growing old with. I will reach all my dreams with you, of course. You are one of those dreams. I‚Äôll do my best to be the best boyfriend ever, and soon, the best husband ever to you.
			 <br>
			  <br> That's all, my love. I hope you enjoyed this little surprise of mine. I miss you a lot, and I can‚Äôt wait to see you and give you a tight hug. <span class="word"> I love you, mwua!ü§çü§çü§ç </span> </p>
