					<p>
						First of all, happy monthsary, my love, hehe. I want to say <Strong>"Sorry"</Strong> po, If it seemed like I forgot to greet you on our monthsary, I want you to know it wasn't intentional. I simply lost track of the date and didn't realize it was already June 1. That's why I didn't have a special message prepared for you. But believe me, I was so excited to be the first to greet you, just like I always do, and I cherish it.
					</p>
					<p>
						I never want to disappoint you, especially with something so important to us. I know you expect me to remember and make you feel special on our monthsary. The truth is, I didn't forget I just got a little mixed up with the dates. I'm so sorry, my love.
					</p>
					<p>
						From now on, I'll make sure to keep a close eye on the calendar so this doesn't happen again. I love you more than words can say, pretty. Always remember that, okay? Mwah!
					</p>
					<p> This is just the start, go back here then click the next envelope beside this one.</p>
